# Weekly Calendar Bases

Weekly Calendar Bases adds a weekly grid view powered by FullCalendar to Obsidian Bases.

## Installation
1. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into `YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/calendar-weekly-bases/`.
2. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin from **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Releases
- This repo mirrors the nightly build used in the vault. After updating the code, attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` to a GitHub release so the community plugin list can pick up the new assets.
- Keep `versions.json` in sync with `manifest.json` to ensure correct compatibility information.
